# HelloWorld-java-maven-app

This repository is for the sample Maven application for demonstrating devops tools

The repository is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
TestNG reports.

The `jenkins` directory contains the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline) and the `jenkins/scripts` subdirectory
contains a shell script with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes the "Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
